- **Static Analysis** - When malware is analyzed without being executed, it is called Static Analysis.
- **Dynamic Analysis** -  It has to execute to fulfil its purpose.

# Static:

## Examining the file type

```
user@machine$ file wannacry 
wannacry: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows 
user@machine$
```

## Examining Strings

```
user@machine$ strings wannacry 
!This program cannot be run in DOS mode. 
Rich 
.text 
`.rdata 
@.data 
.rsrc 
49t$
.
CreateProcessA 
GlobalFree 
GetProcAddress 
LoadLibraryA 
GlobalAlloc 
SetCurrentDirectoryA 
GetCurrentDirectoryA 
GetComputerNameW
```

 you can use the `more` or `less` command to parse the output in a more visible manner: `strings wannacry |more`
## Calculating Hashes

```
user@machine$ md5sum wannacry 
84c82835a5d21bbcf75a61706d8ab549 wannacry 
user@machine$
```

## AV scans and VirusTotal

Scanning a file using AVs or searching for a hash on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)

Sometimes it also provides information about the behavior of a sample and its relations as seen in different environments online.
