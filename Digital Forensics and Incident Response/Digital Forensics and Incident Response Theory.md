## What is DFIR?

As already mentioned, DFIR stands for Digital Forensics and Incident Response. This field covers the collection of forensic artifacts from digital devices such as computers, media devices, and smartphones to investigate an incident. This field helps Security Professionals identify footprints left by an attacker when a security incident occurs, use them to determine the extent of compromise in an environment, and restore the environment to the state it was before the incident occurred. 

## The need for DFIR

DFIR helps security professionals in various ways, some of which are summarized below:

- Finding evidence of attacker activity in the network and sifting false alarms from actual incidents.
- Robustly removing the attacker,  so their foothold from the network no longer remains.
- Identifying the extent and timeframe of a breach. This helps in communicating with relevant stakeholders.
- Finding the loopholes that led to the breach. What needs to be changed to avoid the breach in the future?
- Understanding attacker behavior to pre-emptively block further intrusion attempts by the attacker.
- Sharing information about the attacker with the community.

Eric Zimmerman is a security researcher who has written a few tools to help perform forensic analysis on the Windows platform. These tools help the registry, file system, timeline, and many other analyses. To learn more about these tools, you can check out the [Windows Forensics 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsforensics1) and [Windows Forensics 2](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsforensics2) rooms, where these tools are discussed concerning the different artifacts found in the Windows Operating System.
